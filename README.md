# Get_Next_Line

# Description
This project involves programming a function in C that returns a line read from a file descriptor. The primary functionality is the ability to read and extract lines from a file, facilitating data manipulation in a programming context.

# Key Features
Line Reading: The developed function is capable of reading a line from the file associated with the provided file descriptor parameter.

# Learned Concepts
During the development of this project, I gained essential programming knowledge, including:
Static Variable: I employed concepts of static variables to preserve state between successive calls to the function.
Memory Management: I learned to handle and address memory leaks, ensuring efficient execution without resource wastage.
Linked List: I developed the function using a linked list structure, demonstrating the practical application of this data structure.
